## üéØ Overview

LexiGen is an **open-source** fill-in-the-blank problems generator using local AI with **Zero Cost**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
2. Launch the Ollama app
3. Open the terminal (Windows: press `Windows + R`, then type `cmd`) and install a model (suggesting `qwen2.5:3b` or `qwen2.5:0.5b` (smaller)):
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen2.5:3b
   ```

### Installation

1. Download LexiGen from the [releases page](https://github.com/yourusername/lexigen/releases)
2. Run the installer for your platform
3. Launch LexiGen

## üí° Best Practices

- Customize the prompt in `LexiGenAssets/prompt.txt`, `{word}` is the placeholder for the target word

## üìÇ File Structure

LexiGen now uses a dedicated `LexiGenAssets` folder for all external files:

- `LexiGenAssets/` - The main assets directory
  - `translations/` - Translation files (e.g., zh_CN.json)
  - `prompt.txt` - Custom prompt template file
  - `settings.json` - Application settings

This structure separates application code from user data, making it easier to manage and backup your settings.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No sentence generation | Check if Ollama server is running |
| Connection errors | Use 'Check Server' button |
| Slow performance | Verify system resources or use a smaller model `qwen2.5:0.5b` |
| Model errors | Confirm model installation |

## ü§© Fun Facts

"Lexi" comes from "lexicon".

I considered the name "FibGen" (**F**ill **I**n the **B**lank), however, because "fib" means lie, this name was deserted.
